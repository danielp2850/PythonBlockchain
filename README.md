# PythonBlockchain

A basic blockchain implementation in Python with Proof of Work consensus.

## Description

PythonBlockchain is a basic blockchain project implemented in Python. It demonstrates the concept of a blockchain and uses a simple Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. This project is intended for educational purposes and to help you understand the basic principles of a blockchain.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

- `blockchain.py`: Contains the implementation of the Block and Blockchain classes, along with the PoW algorithm.
- `main.py`: A simple script demonstrating how to create and use the blockchain.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/danielp2850/PythonBlockchain
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd PythonBlockchain
   ```

3. Run It

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

This will create a basic blockchain with two sample transactions.
